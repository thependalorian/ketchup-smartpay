ALIGNMENT SCORES:
=================
Home Dashboard:     70% (Missing transactions list)
Send Money Flow:    40% (Screens consolidated, missing success screen)
Request Money:      90% (Well-structured, minor gaps)
OVERALL:            60% (Action needed)


CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:
=======================

1. HOME DASHBOARD - Missing Transactions List
   File: /app/(tabs)/index.tsx
   Status: ❌ CRITICAL
   Effort: 1.5 hours
   Impact: Users don't see account activity
   Fix: Add TransactionList component after wallets section

2. SEND MONEY - Screens Consolidated
   Files: /app/send-money/*.tsx (multiple files)
   Status: ❌ CRITICAL
   Effort: 4 hours
   Impact: Users can't review payment details properly
   Fix: Split receiver-details into 4 separate screens:
        - amount.tsx
        - payment-method.tsx
        - confirm.tsx
        - success.tsx

3. REQUEST MONEY - Missing Success Screen
   File: /app/request-money/success.tsx (NEW)
   Status: ❌ CRITICAL
   Effort: 2 hours
   Impact: No success confirmation with request ID
   Fix: Create dedicated success screen with request details

4. BUTTON LABELS - Inconsistent
   Files: send-money/receiver-details.tsx, request-money/enter-amount.tsx
   Status: 🟡 IMPORTANT
   Effort: 30 minutes
   Fixes:
   - Send Money Step 2: "Pay" → "Continue"
   - Request Money Step 2: "Continue" → "Send Request"

5. BALANCE VISIBILITY - Not Prominent
   File: /app/send-money/receiver-details.tsx
   Status: 🟡 IMPORTANT
   Effort: 30 minutes
   Fix: Move available balance display before amount input

6. NOTE EXAMPLES - Missing
   File: /app/request-money/enter-amount.tsx
   Status: 🟡 IMPORTANT
   Effort: 30 minutes
   Fix: Add example note tags (Lunch money, Shared expenses, Bill split)


DETAILED BREAKDOWNS:
====================

HOME DASHBOARD FLOW:
───────────────────
Wireframe: Header → Balance → Quick Actions → Wallets → Transactions → Tabs
Current:   Header → Balance → AccountQuickView → Card → Wallets → Utilities → Actions
Missing:   Transactions list (3-5 recent items)
Status:    70% (Missing transactions is critical)


SEND MONEY FLOW:
────────────────
Wireframe: (5 steps)
  Step 1: Select Recipient ✅
  Step 2: Enter Amount ⚠️
  Step 3: Payment Method ❌
  Step 4: Confirmation ❌
  Step 5: Success ❌

Current: (2-3 steps)
  Step 1: Select Recipient ✅
  Step 2: Amount + Method + Note + 2FA ❌ (combined)
  Success: Alert popup ❌

Status: 40% (Need to add 3 missing screens)


REQUEST MONEY FLOW:
───────────────────
Wireframe: (4 steps)
  Step 1: Select Payer ✅
  Step 2: Amount & Note ✅
  Step 3: Confirmation ✅
  Step 4: Success ⚠️

Current: (3 steps with implicit success)
  Step 1: Select Payer ✅
  Step 2: Amount & Note ✅
  Step 3: Confirm + Success (Alert) ⚠️

Status: 90% (Well-structured, minor improvements needed)


IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
=======================

PHASE 1 - CRITICAL FIXES (Week 1):
──────────────────────────────────
Day 1-2:
  [ ] Add transactions list to home (1.5h)
  [ ] Begin send money restructuring (2.5h)
Day 3-4:
  [ ] Complete send money refactoring (4h)
  [ ] Create success screens (2h)
Total: ~10 hours → Achieves 90% alignment

PHASE 2 - POLISH (Week 2):
──────────────────────────
Day 1:
  [ ] Fix button labels (30m)
  [ ] Improve balance visibility (30m)
  [ ] Add note examples (30m)
  [ ] Testing (30m)
Total: ~2 hours → Achieves 95%+ alignment

PHASE 3 - TESTING & QA (Week 2-3):
───────────────────────────────────
  [ ] E2E testing all flows
  [ ] Visual/UX review
  [ ] Bug fixes
  [ ] Performance optimization
Total: ~4 hours


FILE LOCATIONS - KEY FILES:
============================

TO MODIFY:
──────────
/app/(tabs)/index.tsx
  └─ Add transactions list after line 235

/app/send-money/receiver-details.tsx
  └─ Refactor (extract amount logic)

/app/send-money/select-recipient.tsx
  └─ Update navigation to new screens

/app/send-money/_layout.tsx
  └─ Update navigation stack

/app/request-money/enter-amount.tsx
  └─ Add note examples

/app/request-money/confirm.tsx
  └─ Update success navigation


TO CREATE:
──────────
/app/send-money/amount.tsx (NEW)
  └─ Amount entry screen

/app/send-money/payment-method.tsx (NEW)
  └─ Payment source selection

/app/send-money/confirm.tsx (NEW)
  └─ Confirmation with 2FA

/app/send-money/success.tsx (NEW)
  └─ Success with transaction ID

/app/request-money/success.tsx (NEW)
  └─ Request success screen


TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================

SEND MONEY:
───────────
[ ] Step 1: Select recipient works
[ ] Step 2: Amount entry with quick buttons
[ ] Step 3: Payment method selection (new screen)
[ ] Step 4: Confirmation shows all details (new screen)
[ ] Step 5: Success shows transaction ID (new screen)
[ ] "Send Another" restarts flow
[ ] Error handling for insufficient balance
[ ] 2FA modal appears and works
[ ] Back button behavior correct at each step

REQUEST MONEY:
──────────────
[ ] Step 1: Select payer works
[ ] Step 2: Amount and note entry with examples
[ ] Step 3: Confirmation shows all details
[ ] Step 4: Success shows request ID and status
[ ] Note examples clickable and functional
[ ] Back button behavior correct
[ ] Recipient receives notification

HOME DASHBOARD:
────────────────
[ ] Transactions list shows 3-5 items
[ ] Tap transaction opens details
[ ] "View All" link works
[ ] All other sections still functional
[ ] Proper layout and spacing


KEY METRICS:
============
Send Money Screens: 2 → 5 (add 3 screens)
Request Money Flow: 3 → 4 (improve success)
Home Dashboard: Missing → Add transactions list
Overall Alignment: 60% → 95%+ (after implementation)
Total Developer Hours: 13-15 hours
Timeline: 5-8 business days


SUCCESS CRITERIA:
=================
✅ All wireframe screens exist
✅ Button labels match wireframe
✅ Users can review details before payment
✅ Success screens show transaction/request IDs
✅ Home shows recent transactions
✅ All flows tested end-to-end
✅ No regressions in existing features
✅ 2FA integration works seamlessly
✅ Navigation stack properly managed
✅ Engaging UX with animations


CRITICAL RISKS:
===============
1. Send Money Refactoring
   └─ Risk: Breaking existing functionality
   └─ Mitigation: Test thoroughly before removal

2. Payment Processing Integration
   └─ Risk: 2FA and fraud detection integration
   └─ Mitigation: Already implemented, just reorganizing screens

3. Navigation State Management
   └─ Risk: Complex navigation between many screens
   └─ Mitigation: Test all transitions and back buttons


NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Review this report with team
2. Prioritize Phase 1 items
3. Start with transactions list (simplest fix)
4. Move to send money restructuring
5. Create success screens
6. Test thoroughly before release
