# Buffr & Ketchup — G2P & Digital Payments  
## Executive Summary (Play to Win)

**Date:** February 2026  
**Prepared by:** George Nekwaya  
**Reference:** RFP No. SC/RP/NP-09/2023 (Provision of Out of Branch Point of Sale Kiosks and/or Terminals)

---

## Current situation vs proposal

- **Current:** Social grants are **now distributed by Ketchup** (not Epupa). **Buffr was not involved** in the current distribution. Ketchup is the incumbent distributor (SmartPay, voucher issuance, beneficiary data; POS and mobile payment capacity where deployed).
- **Proposal:** This document describes a **solution that could include an SVA (Strategic Value Acquisition) M&A of Buffr by Ketchup**: an integrated G2P and digital payment platform under Ketchup, combining Ketchup’s distribution, voucher issuance and POS with Buffr’s compliance, beneficiary-facing wallet, NAMQR, Open Banking and multi-channel layer. The proposal is for a future combined offering, not the current live setup.

## Proposed ecosystem overview

This business plan presents a **proposed integrated Government-to-Person (G2P) and digital payment ecosystem** (potentially under Ketchup post–Buffr M&A) in which:

- **Government** (e.g. Ministry of Finance) funds and oversees G2P programmes; a **Government Contract Recipient** may hold the central contract for distribution.
- **NamPost** acts as **banking, logistics and supply chain partner** and **financial instrument owner** where contracted.
- **Ketchup Software Solutions** (current grant distributor): **SmartPay** (voucher issuance, beneficiary data), **POS Terminals** (physical payment and cash-out at merchants and agents), mobile payment units for far/remote locations.
- **Buffr** (proposed addition, e.g. via SVA M&A by Ketchup): **compliance and beneficiary-facing platform and distribution layer**—G2P vouchers, UPI-like transactions (including USSD), NAMQR, Open Banking, added financial services, communications and analytics. Today Buffr is not part of live grant distribution.

**Ecosystem alignment:** BoN Open Banking v1.0 and IPP set the regulatory and technical spine. A combined Ketchup–Buffr solution would bring Ketchup’s distribution and issuance together with Buffr’s Open Banking and NAMQR implementation; merchants and agents form the cash-out and payment network alongside any postal/distribution partner.

## Problem: Distribution Bottlenecks & Other Issues (News-Verified)

**What the news reports (2025–2026):**

- **Congestion and long queues:** NamPost and the Ministry of Finance have publicly addressed congestion at post offices during social grant payments. In January 2026, **over 37,000 social grant recipients were paid in a single day** compared to an expected 28,000, overwhelming in-branch services and leading to overcrowding at multiple service points. Beneficiaries not adhering to the payment schedule and travelling to post offices outside their designated dates contributed to the pressure. (The Namibian, 14 Jan 2026; Windhoek Observer.)
- **Transition and criticism (news):** News reported NamPost taking over social grant distribution from **Epupa Investment Technology in October 2025** and subsequent complaints over long queues, delays, and logistical challenges. **In reality, social grants are now distributed by Ketchup** (not Epupa). Buffr was not involved in the current distribution. The congestion and operational issues described in the news are the problem the proposed solution (Ketchup + Buffr, potentially via SVA M&A) would address. (Windhoek Observer; current situation per client.)
- **Rural and remote pay points:** Traditional leaders and residents (e.g. Kavango East and West) raised concerns about overcrowded and unsuitable payment locations, missed visits to rural pay points leaving pensioners stranded and travelling long distances without success, and poor queue management. (Windhoek Observer.)
- **Operational issues:** NamPost and the Economist (Oct 2025) reported challenges including **low-quality pensioner biometrics** slowing transaction duration, **re-registration and payment** in the same round causing delays, and beneficiaries flocking to post offices instead of waiting for **mobile payment teams** at designated pay points.
- **Response in the news:** NamPost and the Ministry of Finance have introduced **stricter payment schedules** (in-branch limited to grant categories per day from 15 Jan 2026) and **deployment of additional mobile payment teams** at selected larger branches to ease congestion. NamPost stated that beneficiaries outside a 5 km radius are to wait for mobile teams; it reported **mobile payment units** operating alongside in-branch, with over 5,000 beneficiaries paid via mobile units in the Rundu area. (The Namibian; Namibia Economist; Observer24.)

**Ketchup’s role today and in the proposed solution:**

- **Current:** Ketchup is the **current social grant distributor** (SmartPay, voucher issuance, beneficiary data; POS and mobile payment units where deployed). Buffr is not in the live distribution chain.
- **Proposed (e.g. post–Buffr SVA M&A):** SmartPay would feed **Buffr** for delivery to beneficiaries (app, USSD, SMS). POS Terminals and mobile units at merchants, agents and far/remote locations; agent network, rural coverage, queue management. The combined Ketchup–Buffr platform would add Buffr’s compliance, wallet, NAMQR and Open Banking layer to Ketchup’s distribution and issuance.

## The Opportunity

**Core opportunity: N$7.2 Billion social grant (F2025/26)**  
- The **N$7.2B annual disbursement** is the **social grant** opportunity: the main G2P flow that drives need for alternative channels (self-help, out-of-office), lower operational cost, more points of service, and single view of customer/inventory/orders/transactions for data-driven insights.

**N$600 Million: Monthly Transaction Volume**  
- Sustained social grant volume (~N$600M/month) driving demand for digital rails, POS integration, agent/merchant network, and settlement efficiency (IPP, Open Banking).

**72% of Beneficiaries Prefer Cash (F2025/26)**  
- Demand for cash-out and cashback at tills; agent and merchant network plus POS terminals reduce congestion at any single channel (e.g. post offices) and improve access.

**Existing Merchant Network: POS Payment Integration**  
- Opportunity to add wallet and voucher redemption to legacy POS; Buffr + Ketchup POS enable merchant payments and cashback without merchants building Open Banking themselves.

**Open Banking & IPP: Enabling Seamless Integrations, Reducing Costs**  
- Open Banking API patterns; ISO 20022 message formats; standardized error responses; financial inclusion through Open X; enterprise account exclusion (Phase 1 focuses on consumer and small business). Buffr is the implemented Open Banking bridge; IPP (PSDIR-11) deadline Feb 2026.

**Additional opportunity, aligned with our proposal: RFP No. SC/RP/NP-09/2023**  
- **Separate from** the N$7.2B social grant: the NamPost RFP (Provision of Out of Branch Point of Sale Kiosks and/or Terminals) is an **additional** opportunity. It is **aligned with what we were proposing**—POS terminal deployment, retail network expansion, cost reduction—with N$6.48–32.4M revenue potential over 3 years where NamPost is partner. Objectives: service availability beyond branches, lower operational cost, rapid network expansion, single view, digital transformation.

**E-Governance Bridge: Expansion to other Ministries**  
- Voucher issuance for social grants, education grants, food relief, medical aid, etc. Issued by Ketchup to beneficiaries via Buffr; validated; physical goods distributed via logistics partners to merchant and agent networks; cash/goods collected or redeemed by beneficiaries through agent and merchant networks.

## The Solution

The proposed solution (Ketchup + Buffr, e.g. via SVA M&A) **addresses the distribution bottlenecks and access gaps described above**—congestion at pay points, rural and remote access, and over-reliance on a single channel—while serving the **N$7.2B social grant** opportunity and remaining **aligned with** the NamPost RFP (POS terminal deployment, retail network expansion, cost reduction).

## Business Case for Ketchup Software Solutions

The following economics support the commercial case for the combined platform:

- **Value Capture from N$600 Million Monthly Volume:** Agent and merchant networks alleviate bottlenecks (enrollments, biometric verifications, cash-outs) across the ecosystem; value capture from MDR, cash-out fees, cashback processing, government transaction fees.

- **Long-Term Strategic Partnerships:** Win favor of distribution partners (e.g. NamPost); potential to supply Ketchup POS infrastructure to replace legacy systems and deliver customer insights.

- **Ketchup POS Terminals: Leasing Model.** Leasing of Ketchup POS Terminals to agents (e.g. 5-year contract).  
  **Unit economics (per agent):**  
  - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** N$6,659 (includes sales, visits, POS terminal with bank charges & shipping, training, incentives).  
  - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):** N$55,500 (5-year lifetime revenue per agent; MDR share + cash-out fees, at ~N$925/month avg).  
  - **CLTV:CAC ratio:** ~8.3:1 (above 3:1 benchmark).  
  - **CAC payback:** ~6–7 months.  
  **Company-level:**  
  - **Break-Even Point (BEP):** Month 15–18 (Year 2), with requirements: N$2M+ monthly revenue, 150+ active agents/merchants, 40,000+ active users, N$100M+ monthly transaction volume.  
  *Source: KETCHUP_POS_TERMINAL_BUSINESS_PLAN.md (CAC/CLTV, cohort analysis, break-even); PRD_BUFFR_G2P_VOUCHER_PLATFORM.md (beneficiary CAC/CLTV, BEV).*

- **Consumer Data: Strategic Asset.** Data supports strategic consultation to Government (policy), distribution partners (financial instruments), NamRA (automated tax collection), Namibia Statistics Agency (census enrichment), BIPA, etc.

- **Increase in Government Contracts:** Ketchup Software Solutions aims to become the preferred social grants distributor: enhance operational efficiency, reduce operational costs, provide transparency through G2P voucher solution—directly or through Government Contract Recipients.
