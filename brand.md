### About

**Ketchup SmartPay Brand Guidelines**

Ketchup SmartPay is the **G2P engine** at the heart of the BUFFR G2P Voucher ecosystem: system of record for voucher lifecycle, beneficiary registry, Token Vault, compliance, and admin/government portals. We promote secure, equitable disbursement of government-to-person (G2P) benefits, driven by a production-grade, compliance-first platform aligned with PSD-1, ETA, NAMQR, and Open Banking.

Ketchup SmartPay is committed to **security, transparency, and inclusion**. We embrace standards and practices that make disbursements reliable and accessible. We continuously look inward at our own systems to ensure we meet our goal of **100% PSD compliance** and equitable access. As the orchestration layer for Namibia’s G2P economy, Ketchup SmartPay works with government, agents, and partners to embed these values across the ecosystem. We are dedicated to a **just and efficient** transition to digital G2P, one that reduces friction, protects beneficiaries, and scales to every community. This is the path to a prosperous, trusted G2P future that benefits all.

| Focus areas |
|-------------|
| **Vouchers** · **Beneficiaries** · **Agents** · **Compliance** · **Open Banking** · **Government Oversight** · **Token Vault** · **Reconciliation** |

### Mission

**Ketchup SmartPay powers the just, secure, and efficient delivery of G2P benefits and payments.**

| 01 | 02 | 03 |
|----|----|-----|
| All beneficiaries in the ecosystem, regardless of location or device, have access to secure voucher redemption and payment options. | Transition to digital G2P empowers a strong agent network, integrates technology seamlessly into disbursement and redemption, and maintains full audit trails. | Ketchup SmartPay is at the center of the G2P stack, connecting government, portals, agents, and beneficiaries—enabling innovation to take root and compliance to scale. |

# 02 Logo

## Logotype / Logomark / Logo Variations

### Primary Logo — Description

The **primary Ketchup SmartPay logo** is a circular emblem (logomark) consisting of:

- **Central element:** A bold **black sans-serif letter “K”** with rounded, fluid strokes. The diagonal arms extend from the vertical bar in a continuous, strong shape. The “K” has a subtle dimensional quality and reads clearly against the sphere.
- **Background sphere:** A **perfect circle** divided into **four quadrants**, each with a distinct brand color and smooth gradients that give a spherical, modern feel. The “K” acts as the visual divider between the quadrants.
- **Quadrant colors (clockwise from top-left):** **Lime green** · **Magenta / fuchsia** · **Royal blue** · **Sunny yellow** (see [Color Palette](#03-color) for exact values).
- **Effect:** A subtle **dark gray drop shadow** beneath the unit is part of the approved lockup and adds elevation; do not remove it in standard applications.

This mark represents **clarity, trust, and connectivity** in G2P payments—modern, recognizable, and scalable across portals (Ketchup Portal, Government Portal), app icons, and integrations (BUFFR, agents, API).

**Primary asset:** `apps/ketchup-portal/public/ketchup-logo.png`

### Logo Type

**Download Assets**

| 01 | 02 |
|----|-----|
| **Primary logo** | The primary logo (circular “K” in color sphere) is for hero material and key touchpoints (app headers, government portal, favicon, partner materials). |
| **Brand mark** | The mark stands out on both dark and light backdrops when clear space is maintained. Use the full-sphere lockup; do not alter the four quadrants or the “K” letterform. |

---

### Horizontal Logo

**Download Assets**

| 01 | 02 |
|----|-----|
| The horizontal logo is designed to accommodate different layout needs (headers, letterhead, banners). | The horizontal lockup opens up the mark to transition from square to rectangular proportions for wide layouts. |

| White backdrop | Dark backdrop |
|----------------|---------------|
| Use on light backgrounds (documents, web light theme). | Use on dark backgrounds (dashboards, dark mode). |

---

### Logo Mark

**Mark**

The **logomark** is the circular unit itself: the bold black “K” inside the four-quadrant color sphere. Once brand recognition is established, this **isolated mark** (without the word “Ketchup SmartPay”) can be used alone in specific situations—e.g. favicon, app icon, social profile picture, small UI badges.

**Source:** Use `ketchup-logo.png` from `apps/ketchup-portal/public/` (or the approved export from brand assets).

**Download Assets**

| White backdrop | Dark backdrop |
|----------------|---------------|
| Favicon, app icon on light. | App icon, social avatar on dark. |

---

### Word Mark

**Secondary Logo**

| 01 | 02 |
|----|-----|
| The word mark is meant to be used only for specific circumstances where legibility is compromised due to **extremely small scaling** (e.g. report footers, invoice borders, small print). | Use “Ketchup SmartPay” or “SmartPay” word mark when the full logo does not fit. |

**Download Assets**

| White backdrop | Dark backdrop |
|----------------|---------------|
| Small print on light. | Small print on dark. |

---

### Logo Space

| 01 | 02 | 03 |
|----|-----|-----|
| The logo is designed for consistent placement; the circular mark has a defined center and proportions. | To achieve maximum impact and legibility, **clear space** must be maintained around the logo. Use the **diameter of the circle** (or the height of the “K”) as the measuring unit for minimum clearance. | When aligning the logo alongside other elements (e.g. “Ketchup SmartPay” logotype), keep these implied guidelines in mind. |

---

### Logo Variations

**Tagline**

This variation of the logo replaces or supplements the name with a tagline (e.g. *Powering the G2P Economy*, *Namibian G2P Engine*).

**Download Assets**

---

**Values**

This variation can include Ketchup SmartPay’s key values alongside the tagline (e.g. **Secure · Compliant · Equitable**).

**Download Assets**

---

**Values Masked**

This variation uses framed cutouts of key values over imagery (e.g. hero banners). Use only where the backdrop is a **photo or texture**, not a solid color.

**Download Assets**

---

### Logo Misuses — What NOT to do

Adhering to these rules will ensure brand consistency.

**Download Assets**

| Do not | Do not |
|--------|--------|
| Change the colors of the logo beyond the approved palette (sphere quadrants and black “K”). | Alter the “K” letterform, stroke weight, or proportions. |
| Rearrange or separate the “K” and the sphere; do not delete quadrants or elements. | Add *additional* drop shadows or visual effects beyond the approved lockup. |
| Stretch, skew, or rotate the logo. | Use low-contrast versions (e.g. pale “K” on pale background) unless an approved alternate is provided. |

---

### Choosing the Right Logo

| Use case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Hero visuals** (signage, badges, splash) with minimal copy | **Vertical (primary) logo** |
| **Hero visuals** where the tagline is the main headline | **Vertical logo – tagline variation** |
| **Overlay on imagery** that represents value (e.g. agents, beneficiaries) | **Vertical logo – values variation** (masked on image only) |
| **Landscape layout** with minimal copy (business card, banner, letterhead) | **Horizontal logo** |
| **End slides** of presentations, videos, animations | **Vertical or horizontal logo** (as per layout) |
| **Portrait layouts** with extensive content (e.g. long reports, posters) | **Horizontal logo** (corners, not center) |
| **Co-branding** (next to another organization’s logo) | Always place **Ketchup SmartPay logo on the left**. |
| **Internal pages / borders** of print material where space is tight | **Secondary (word) mark** |

---

### Logo Application Misuses

| Don’t | Don’t |
|-------|-------|
| Use the vertical logo in layouts with extensive content where the logo’s legibility is compromised. | Align the horizontal logo in the **center** of the layout; reserve center alignment for the vertical logo only. Horizontal logo should sit in **corners**. |
| Use the vertical **values masked** variation on top of **solid colors** or with altered copy color; this variation is **only for use on imagery**. | Use low-contrast combinations (e.g. light logo on light background) without the approved palette. |

---

# 03 Color

| **03. Lime Green** | ~R132 G204 B22 | `#84CC16` | **Logo sphere** (top-left quadrant); energy, growth. |
| **04. Magenta** | ~R192 G38 B211 | `#C026D3` | **Logo sphere** (top-right quadrant); bold accent. |

- **Forest** and **Accent Green** are the core brand colors for product UI—trust and action.
- **Seafoam** and **Sand Gray** support readability and hierarchy on light backgrounds.

| 100% | 90% | 80% | 70% | 60% | 50% | 40% | 30% | 20% | 10% |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

**Midnight** (`#001818`) can be expanded by tints for dark mode and contrast.

| 100% | 90% | 80% | 70% | 60% | 50% | 40% | 30% | 20% | 10% |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

---

### Color Hierarchy

# 05 Photography

## Imagery / Style / Usage

### Landscape / Lifestyle / Energy / Satellite (adapted for G2P)

Categories below are adapted from environmental/climate imagery to **fintech and G2P**: trust, people, technology, and place.

---

### Landscape Images

**Download Assets**

| 01 | 02 | 03 |
|----|-----|-----|
| Photography should show **context**: disbursement regions, agent areas, community settings. Natural and built landscapes with a clear focal point. | Use **warm, earthy and analogous tones**. Lighting should be clear and professional to support trust and clarity. | Use as **backdrop treatment** for key messages (e.g. hero banners) when following the guidelines above. |

---

### Landscape Don’ts

| Avoid | Avoid | Avoid |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Too many competing elements; colors and textures that don’t work cohesively. | Saturation that feels artificial or off-brand. | Missing sharp lighting and a clear hero subject. |
| Dull colors and chaotic framing. | Faded or inconsistent lighting. | Static angles with no sense of place or scale. |

---

### Energy / Technology Images

**Download Assets**

| 01 | 02 | 03 |
|----|-----|-----|
| Focus on **payments and technology in use**: devices, agents, vouchers, POS, mobile units. Shot angle should capture a **dynamic element** (action, device in hand, screen). | Colors should align with the **brand palette** (greens, neutrals, light blues) or analogous professional tones. | When people appear, they should be the **main subject**, with technology or process serving as the backdrop. |

---

### Energy / Technology Don’ts

| Avoid | Avoid | Avoid |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Confusing angle where technology or action is lost. | Black and white or low exposure unless intentionally editorial. | Wrong main subject (e.g. tech lost in backdrop). |
| Somber or untrustworthy lighting. | Wrong subject or oversaturated color. | Abstract framing with no clear subject; chaotic framing with competing elements. |

---

### Region / Place Images (Northeast → Namibia)

**Download Assets**

| 01 | 02 | 03 |
|----|-----|-----|
| Subjects: **regions Ketchup SmartPay serves** (e.g. Namibia, agent networks, communities). Natural and urban landscapes, buildings, local context. | Variety: city and rural, different regions and use cases. | To portray impact, include **varied seasons and conditions** where relevant (e.g. outreach, field operations). |

**Don’t:** Bad lighting, generic stock that doesn’t reflect region or context.

---

### Lifestyle Images

**Download Assets**

| 01 | 02 | 03 |
|----|-----|-----|
| Capture **real moments**: beneficiaries, agents, partners in activity or reaction. | **Candid** moments of emotion or focus; avoid rigid posing or lack of activity. | Tones can be warm or cool but should be **consistent** when using more than one image in a layout. |

**Lifestyle Don’ts:** Posed subjects; no movement or reaction; low exposure; bad lighting.

---

### Satellite / Abstract (Data & Systems)

**Download Assets**

| 01 | 02 | 03 |
|----|-----|-----|
| Use for **abstract or system-level themes**: data, networks, coverage, compliance. Satellite or map-inspired imagery can represent scale and reach. | Balance **texture and color** for cohesiveness; avoid chaotic or synthetic looks. | Use as **backdrop** for content (e.g. dashboards, reports) when following the guidelines above. |

**Satellite Don’ts:** Overly synthetic colors; literal globe clichés; angles that don’t support the concept.

---

# 06 Graphic Elements

## Badges / Frame / Brackets / Effects

The **primary logo** (circular “K” in the four-quadrant color sphere) can inspire secondary graphical elements: the **segmented sphere** or the **“K” letterform** may be used in frames, patterns, or accents when consistent with these guidelines. Do not alter the approved logo lockup itself.

---

### Member / Partner Badges

**Vertical** · **Download Assets**

| Silver | Gold | Platinum |
|--------|------|----------|
| Partner / participant level. | Committed partner level. | Top-tier / excellence level. |

**Horizontal** · **Download Assets**

Use when layout requires a wide lockup (footers, partner strips).

---

### Badge Lockup

**Download Assets**

- **Silver:** “This organization participates in the Ketchup SmartPay G2P ecosystem.”
- **Gold:** “This organization is committed to driving secure, compliant G2P delivery with Ketchup SmartPay.”
- **Platinum:** “This organization excels in the equitable and secure G2P economy with Ketchup SmartPay.”

---

### Open Frame

**Download Assets**

The frame from the logo can be isolated as a **branded graphic element** to focus the viewer’s attention on a subject, metric, or area. Use strategically.

| 01 | 02 |
|----|-----|
| Frame should **not exceed 2/3 of the page** (or viewport). | Frame **thickness** should be adjusted according to size (e.g. thicker for large hero, thinner for small UI). |

---

### Open Brackets

**Download Assets**

The “negative” of the frame creates **brackets** that highlight content without overlapping it—e.g. framing photos or key stats.

| 01 | 02 |
|----|-----|
| Brackets **frame content** (e.g. photos, cards) rather than overlapping subjects. | Bracket **thickness** should scale with layout. |

---

### Open Arrows

**Download Assets**

Corners from the open brackets can be used as **arrows** to suggest movement (e.g. flow, process, next step). Avoid rotating the arrow back to a right-angle corner.

| 01 | 02 |
|----|-----|
| Images can be **masked within** the arrow shape where appropriate. | Use **2–3 arrows per layout** for movement; avoid clutter. |

---

### Blur Effect

**Download Assets**

Blurring can **frame content** and create space for copy overlay.

| 01 | 02 |
|----|-----|
| Busy images can be **blurred** to reduce visual weight and improve legibility of text. | Combine with **frame or bracket** elements to reinforce hierarchy. |

**Example:** *Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet* over a softly blurred background.

---

  ketchup: {
    midnight: 'var(--ketchup-midnight)',
    forest: 'var(--ketchup-forest)',
    lime: 'var(--ketchup-lime)',
    magenta: 'var(--ketchup-magenta)',
    royal: 'var(--ketchup-royal)',
    yellow: 'var(--ketchup-yellow)',
    accent: 'var(--ketchup-accent)',
    sand: 'var(--ketchup-sand)',
    seafoam: 'var(--ketchup-seafoam)',

  },
}
```

## CSS Variables

```css
:root {
  /* Brand Colors */
  --ketchup-midnight: #001818;
  --ketchup-forest: #226644;
