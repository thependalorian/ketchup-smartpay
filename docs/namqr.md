# 3. Executive Summary The executive summary provides a brief overview of the NAMQR Code Standards which were developed in line with the Bank of Namibia’s (the Bank) Strategy (2021-2024), to drive a digital transformation and modernised financial sector, the National Payment System (NPS) Vision and Strategy (2021-2025), under Theme 3: Consumer-Centric Innovation and the need by the NPS industry for standardised QR Codes. The Standards are based on the Bank’s Guidelines, EMVCo QR Code standards, the Instant Payment Solution (IPS) QR specification document, and the Bank’s relevant cybersecurity legal framework, among others and aims to ensure that payment QR codes are interoperable, safe, secure, and universally acceptable by all acquirers within the NPS and further promotes financial inclusion by enabling rural and informal vendors to accept digital payments, by expanding access to digital financial services.
The standardisation of the NAMQR Codes will promote payment choice, convenience, security as well as support interoperability across all payment streams, which facilitates a seamless user experience. These standards offer guidelines for the creation, encoding, and decoding of QR Codes, ensuring they are universally readable and optimised for performance. The detailed technical specifications provide for the establishment of a common structure and format for QR codes, including the length or size, error correction level, and encoding scheme, to ensure that they can be easily scanned and processed by various payment platforms.
## The NAMQR Code will enhance the user experience by simplifying the process of initiating and accepting payments between customers and merchants. These Standards allow for the customisation of QR Codes while ensuring their scannability and helping to future-proof the technology as it evolves. Ultimately, the successful adoption of the NAMQR Code Standards will be defined by the simplicity, convenience, and security of making digital payments in Namibia.

# 4. NAMQR Code Specifications 4.1 Purpose This section provides:
## (a) A brief description of payee and payer presented NAMQR code payment, and the entities involved.
(b) The requirements on the NAMQR code displayed by the payee and payer, including format and content.
The processing of the NAMQR code by the mobile application and the network messages as a
## result of this processing are out of scope of this section.
4.2 High level transaction flows for Payee and Payer presented NAMQR code payments1 The granular details of the user journeys, functional specifications, the network message flows and formats, test and error case scenarios, alerts and calls to action for actual processing of the NAMQR code by the mobile application and / or USSD, are out of scope of this document.
4.3 Payee presented NAMQR code payment – using smart phone mobile banking application The payee presented NAMQR code payment transaction enables payer to make payment using a payee generated and displayed NAMQR code based on the payee’s details. For example, it can be used for a transfer of funds to a payee account designated by the payee account information over a payment network.
Payer is issued a mobile application that has the capability to scan the payee presented NAMQR code and initiate a payment transaction. This mobile application may be an existing mobile banking app offered by the Payer PSP or a third-party application provider. In both cases, the request to process the payment transaction is ultimately directed to the Payer PSP managing the account from which the funds will be withdrawn.
## The Payer PSP receives the initial payment transaction and secures or withdraws the transaction amount from the payer’s account.
## Upon receiving the payment transaction, the Payee PSP checks the validity of payee credentials
(i.e., payee identifier alias value), resolves the payee identifier (if valid) to payee account information (e.g., bank account, e-money account, card account), credits the payment transaction amount associated with the payee account information, and sends notification of a successful transaction to payee. The Payer PSP also provides a notification to the payer (typically to their mobile application).
## 1 Transaction flows shown here are for illustration purpose only and not specific to existing Namibia payment systems.

The payee presented NAMQR code payment (using smart phone mobile banking application)
## transaction flow is illustrated as follows:
Generation of NAMQR code with Payee Identifier and Token Vault Unique Identifier 1. Payee initiates NAMQR code generation on payee PSP app and selects the bank account /
e-money account / card account to be used for payment transaction (along with amount,
## transaction currency and any other parameters as required).
# 2. Payee PSP app sends ‘Generate NAMQR’ request to payee PSP.
# 3. Payee PSP assigns a payee identifier to the payee as an alias (e.g., payee mobile number as alias or any other unique number as assigned by payee PSP). The corresponding bank account / e-money account / card account details (selected at the time of NAMQR generation)
are available at the payee PSP end mapped against the payee identifier. Payee PSP sends the parameters related to NAMQR to Token Vault 2
# 4. Token Vault stores the NAMQR parameters and map them against a Token Vault Unique Identifier and sends this xx-digit unique identifier to payee PSP 5. Payee PSP generates NAMQR with the assigned Payee Identifier, Token Vault Unique Identifier (in tag 65) and other parameters and NAMQR code is displayed on the payee PSP app (refer section ‘NAMQR code payload data objects’ for details of the parameters in NAMQR code)
Scanning of NAMQR code by payer PSP app and validation of NAMQR parameters through Token Vault 6. Payer scans NAMQR code using a mobile application (payer PSP app)
# 7. Payer PSP app sends the NAMQR code validation request to Payer PSP with list of NAMQR code parameters as scanned 8. Payer PSP sends the NAMQR code validation request to Token Vault 9. Token Vault validates the NAMQR code parameters as scanned with the NAMQR parameters available in the Token Vault, and sends the NAMQR code validation successful response to payer PSP 10. Payer PSP sends the NAMQR code validation successful response to payer PSP app 2 Token Vault may be hosted centrally or at bank side as per compliance with standard specifications Transaction processing 11. Payer initiates and authenticates the transaction using 2FA on payer PSP app 12. Payer PSP app sends the transaction initiation request to payer PSP.
# 13. Payer PSP debits the payer account (based on the credentials) and sends transaction request 3 to payment network (e.g., NRTC, EnCR, IPP).
# 14. Payment network sends transaction request to payee PSP.
# 15. Payee PSP checks the validity of payee credentials (i.e., payee identifier alias value), resolves the payee identifier (if valid) to payee account information (e.g., bank account, e-money account, card account), credits the payment transaction amount associated with the payee account information and sends response to payment network.
# 16. Payment network sends response to payer PSP.
# 17. Payer PSP and payee PSP inform payer and payee respectively of the transaction outcome.
## Different message flows are possible between the entities involved, depending on type of account
(payer bank account or third-party e-money wallet) and the infrastructure supported by the payment network. Note that the specifics of this message flow from the mobile to the payment network is out of scope of this document.
## 3 The request from payer PSP to payment network can be sent as per the message format defined by the respective payment network (e.g., ISO 20022, ISO 8583, proprietary XML, etc) . For e.g., If NRTC is used to send the transaction, NRTC message formats shall be used for transmission of message from payer PSP to payment network and so on. Payer PSP app shall scan and read NAMQR code and populate the respective values in the request and send to payer PSP (as per the message format defined between payer PSP app and payer PSP switch), similarly payer PSP switch sends the request to payment network as per message format defined by the payment network. NAMQR code specifications only provides mechanism for payer PSP app to read data related to payee / merchant and does not affect the back-end transaction processing.

# 4.4 Payee presented NAMQR code payment (using USSD channel)
The payee presented NAMQR code payment (using USSD channel) transaction flow is illustrated as follows:
Generation of NAMQR code with Payee Identifier and Token Vault Unique Identifier 1. Payee initiates NAMQR code generation on payee PSP app and selects the bank account /

# 16. Payment network sends response to payer PSP.
# 17. Payer PSP and payee PSP inform payer and payee respectively of the transaction outcome.
# 4.5 Payer presented NAMQR code payment – (Request to Pay)
In a payer presented NAMQR Code transaction, payers can make payments—using credentials associated with their bank account / card account / e-money wallet and previously provisioned to their device—by selecting the NAMQR option for payment within their mobile application, which will result in the display of the NAMQR Code and having that NAMQR Code scanned at the time of payment to complete the transaction.
These transactions are always authorised online and given that the scanning of the NAMQR Code is a one-way transfer of data from the payer’s device to the POI, the payload of the NAMQR Code does not contain any data from the POI.

## The high-level solution architecture for the payer presented NAMQR code payment is as follows:
Generation of NAMQR code with Payer Identifier and Token Vault Unique Identifier 1. Payer initiates NAMQR code generation on payer PSP app and selects the bank account / emoney account / card account to be used for payment transaction (along with amount,
## transaction currency if required).
# 2. Payer PSP app sends ‘Generate NAMQR’ request to payer PSP.
# 3. Payer PSP assigns a payer identifier to the payer as an alias (e.g., payer mobile number as alias or any other unique number as assigned by payer PSP). The corresponding bank account / e-money account / card account details (selected at the time of NAMQR generation)
are available at the payer PSP end mapped against the payer identifier. Payer PSP sends the parameters related to NAMQR to Token Vault 5
# 4. Token Vault stores the NAMQR parameters and map them against a Token Vault Unique Identifier and sends this xx-digit unique identifier to payer PSP 5. Payer PSP generates NAMQR with the assigned Payer Identifier, Token Vault Unique Identifier (in tag 65) and other parameters and NAMQR code is displayed on the payer PSP app (refer section ‘NAMQR code payload data objects’ for details of the parameters in NAMQR code)
Scanning of NAMQR code by payee PSP app and validation of NAMQR parameters through Token Vault 6. Payee scans NAMQR code using a mobile application (payee PSP app)
# 7. Payee PSP app sends the NAMQR code validation request to Payee PSP with list of NAMQR code parameters as scanned 8. Payee PSP sends the NAMQR code validation request to Token Vault 9. Token Vault validates the NAMQR code parameters as scanned with the NAMQR parameters available in the Token Vault, and sends the NAMQR code validation successful response to payee PSP 10. Payee PSP sends the NAMQR code validation successful response to payee PSP app 5 Token Vault may be hosted centrally or at bank side as per compliance with standard specifications Transaction processing 11. Payee initiates the transaction 12. Payee PSP app sends the transaction initiation request to payee PSP.
# 13. Payee PSP sends transaction to payment network (e.g., IPP).
# 14. Payment network sends transaction to payer PSP.
# 15. Payer PSP checks the validity of payer credentials (i.e., payer identifier alias value), resolves the payer identifier (if valid) to payer account information (e.g., bank account, e-money account, card account), sends request to payer mobile to authenticate the transaction.
# 16. Payer views payee name and authenticates with M-PIN to pay through the bank account / emoney account / card account (selected at the time of NAMQR generation).
# 17. Payer PSP debits the payer account (based on the credentials) and sends transaction request to payment network.
# 18. Payment network sends transaction request to payee PSP.
# 19. Payee PSP credits the payee account and sends response to payment network.
# 20. Payment network sends response to payer PSP.
# 21. Payer PSP and payee PSP inform payer and payee respectively of the transaction outcome.
4.6 Strawman approach - Interoperable transaction from customer bank account on payment stream (e.g., NRTC, EnCR) to merchant on POSD stream 6
Generation of NAMQR code with Merchant Identifier and Token Vault Unique Identifier 1. Merchant initiates NAMQR code generation on merchant app (e.g., POS terminal, ecommerce website) with amount, transaction currency.
# 2. Merchant app sends ‘Generate NAMQR’ request to Acquirer PSP.
## 6 This conceptual flow is for illustration purpose only and can be customized as per actual respective payment stream specifications 3. Acquirer PSP assigns a merchant identifier to the merchant as an alias. The corresponding account details are available at the Acquirer PSP end mapped against the merchant identifier.
## Acquirer PSP sends the parameters related to NAMQR to Token Vault 4. Token Vault stores the NAMQR parameters and map them against a Token Vault Unique Identifier and sends this xx-digit unique identifier to Acquirer PSP 5. Acquirer PSP generates NAMQR with the assigned Merchant Identifier, Token Vault Unique Identifier (in tag 65) and other parameters and NAMQR code is displayed on the merchant app (refer section ‘NAMQR code payload data objects’ for details of the parameters in NAMQR code)
## NAMQR parameters include the following:
Mandatory tags and parameters for static QR:
## (00) – Payload format indicator
## (01) – Point of initiation method
(02 - 16) – Tag to be followed by length and data as defined by card payment networks
(52) – Merchant category code
(58) – Country code
(59) – Payee name
## (60) – Payee city
## (65) – Token Vault Unique Identifier

4.9 NAMQR code payload data objects9 The data contained within a NAMQR code is organized as follows. Each data object is made up of three individual fields. The first field is a tag field by which the data object can be referenced.
The second field is a length field that explicitly indicates the number of characters included in the third field i.e., the value field. A data object is then represented as a Tag - Length - Value (TLV)
## combination, where:
# 1. The tag is coded as a two-digit numeric value, with a value ranging from "00" to "99",
# 2. The length is coded as a two-digit numeric value, with a value ranging from "01" to "99",
# 3. The value field has a minimum length of one character and maximum length of 99 characters.
## The Payload Format Indicator (tag 00) is the first data object. The tag 63 is cyclical redundancy check (CRC) and always the last object. The position of all other data objects is arbitrary and may appear in any order. Data objects within a template, such as the Additional Data Field Template
## (tag 62), may be placed in any position under their respective templates.
## The format of a value field in a data object is either Numeric (N), Alphabetic (A), Alphanumeric
(AN), Alphanumeric Special (ANS), or String (S). Note that Numeric is a subset of Alphanumeric Special and that Alphanumeric Special is a subset of String.
Alphanumeric format indicates that the data object may be coded using any characters from the
## [ISO 18004:2006-QR Code 2005 barcode symbology specs] alphanumeric mode, including the 9
symbol characters. Numeric format indicates the numeric decimal data 0-9 as defined in [ISO 18004:2006-QR Code 2005 barcode symbology specs].
## 9 Refer document ‘EMVCo-Merchant-Presented-QR-Specification-v1.1’ and ‘UPI Linking Specification cer 1 7 2_V12’

The length of the payload should not exceed 512 alphanumeric characters, and the number of characters should be reduced proportionally when multi-byte [Unicode] characters are used.
Note that, as data object values with a format of S may contain characters coded as UTF-8 and depending on the alphabet being used there may not be a one-to-one mapping of characters to bytes, special consideration would be needed to determine the number of bytes in the payload.
The table below lists the name of the data object, the tag of the data object, the length of the value field of the data object, the format of the value field of the data object, and whether the presence of the data object is Mandatory (M), Conditional (C), or Optional (O).
## Following is the definition for the header used in the below table:
S - Static QR and D - Dynamic QR 4.10 Table: 1 Name Tag Format Length Presence Description S D Payload 00 N 02 M M Defines the version of the NAMQR template and the conventions on the tags,
## Format lengths and values.
## Indicator Payload Format Indicator is the first data object in the NAMQR code and allows the mobile application to determine the data representation of the remaining data included in the NAMQR code and how to parse the data.
In this version of the specification, the Payload Format Indicator has the value
## "01".
If this Payload Format Indicator has the value "99" (or any such value), then all tags as per existing EMVCo standards for customer presented card chip data to be followed (refer section ‘EMVCo standards for customer presented card chip data’).10 Point of 01 N 02 M M Identifies the communication technology (here QR code) and whether the data initiation is static or dynamic.
## method The Point of Initiation Method has the following values:
# 1. "11" for payee presented static NAMQR codes 2. "12" for payee presented dynamic NAMQR codes.
3. “13” for payer presented static NAMQR codes 4. “14” for payer presented dynamic NAMQR codes 10 It must be noted that, EMVCo uses binary encoding for customer presented card chip data to generate QR code. We retained this protocol to ensure that this payment method is not excluded while developing NAMQR, by using value “99” (or any such value) in the tag “00” (in this case,
all tags as per existing EMVCo standards for customer presented card chip data to be followed). To ensure compatibility with rest of QR code parameters which are only text based, EMVCo has provided mechanism for converting binary data to text data using base64 and encoding in a
QR code. Hence, NAMQR parameters continue to have uniform text-based encoding despite including this particular EMVCo use case. It must be further noted that in all other use cases in these NAMQR specifications for Payer presented QR, only text-based encoding has been envisaged.

The above describes the only acceptable format. It cannot contain any other characters CRC 63 ANS 04 M M Checksum calculated over all the data objects included in the NAMQR code.
## The CRC (tag 63) is the last data object in the NAMQR code and allows the mobile application to check the integrity of the data scanned without having to parse all of the data objects.
The checksum shall be calculated according to [ISO / IEC 13239] using the polynomial '1021' (hex) and initial value 'FFFF' (hex). The data over which the checksum is calculated shall cover all data objects, including their Tag, Length and Value, to be included in the NAMQR Code, in their respective order, as well as the Tag and Length of the CRC itself (but excluding its Value).
Following the calculation of the checksum, the resulting 2-byte hexadecimal value shall be encoded as a 4-character Alphanumeric Special value by converting each nibble to the corresponding Alphanumeric Special character.
A nibble with hex value ‘0’ is converted to “0” (= hex value ‘30’), a nibble with hex value ‘1’ is converted to “1” (= hex value ‘31’) and so on. Hex values ‘A’ to
‘F’ must be converted to uppercase characters “A” to “F” (= hex values ‘41’ to
## ‘46’).

## The CRC (tag 63) is the last data object in the NAMQR code and allows the mobile application to check the integrity of the data scanned without having to parse all of the data objects.
The checksum shall be calculated according to [ISO / IEC 13239] using the polynomial '1021' (hex) and initial value 'FFFF' (hex). The data over which the checksum is calculated shall cover all data objects, including their Tag, Length and Value, to be included in the NAMQR Code, in their respective order, as well as the Tag and Length of the CRC itself (but excluding its Value).
Following the calculation of the checksum, the resulting 2-byte hexadecimal value shall be encoded as a 4-character Alphanumeric Special value by converting each nibble to the corresponding Alphanumeric Special character.
A nibble with hex value ‘0’ is converted to “0” (= hex value ‘30’), a nibble with hex value ‘1’ is converted to “1” (= hex value ‘31’) and so on. Hex values ‘A’ to
‘F’ must be converted to uppercase characters “A” to “F” (= hex values ‘41’ to
## ‘46’).

The following describes the high-level functionality of various components of the QR code processing architecture on the consumer device:
# 1. Mobile application / wallet – A consumer-facing user interface (UI) application provided by the issuer and provisioned to the customer’s mobile device. It includes the functionality to encode the payment credentials based on this specification and then displays the resulting QR code.
# 2. QR code payload – The payload, consisting of payment token credentials and other data based on this specification, converted to base64 and encoded in a QR code.
## The customer device functional view is as follows:
## There are 2 logical components on the merchant device: the QR code reader and the POI application.
# 1. QR code reader: Scans the QR code, decodes the QR code and sends the data recovered to the POI system. This data constitutes the base64 encoded QR code payload.
# 2. POI application: The application developed by the POI vendor to process the base64 encoded QR code payload defined in this specification. Its functions include base64 decoding, parsing the data,
checking content and format and transaction processing.
## Merchant device functional view is as follows:
## Office Use Only\Internal April 2025 On the network the following are the roles as per the existing EMV infrastructure:
# 1. Acquirer—The acquirer / processor processing the authorization transaction received from the merchant.
# 2. Payment Network—Responsible for transaction routing to the issuer and any corresponding tokenization services and functions.
# 3. Issuer—The issuer of the original payment card, that is used in the QR Code transaction.

# 4.12 Key points related to NAMQR code specifications
(a) For payee presented NAMQR, MCC contains value ‘0000’. Tag 17 is reserved for payee presented NAMQR for existing Namibia payment system that does not use PAN or IPP full form alias as payee identifier. Tag 26 and 27 are reserved for payee presented NAMQR for IPP payee full form alias reference.
(b) For payer presented NAMQR, point of initiation method contains value ‘13’ or ‘14’ and MCC contains value ‘0000’. Tag 28 is reserved for payer presented NAMQR for existing Namibia payment system that does not use PAN or IPP full form alias as payee identifier. Tag 29 is reserved for payer presented NAMQR for IPP payer full form alias reference.
## (c) For merchant presented NAMQR, replace ‘payee’ with ‘merchant’, ‘payer’ with ‘customer’,
‘payee PSP’ with ‘acquirer PSP’, ‘payer PSP’ with ‘issuer PSP’ in the section ‘NAMQR code payload data objects’.
## (d) Merchant presented NAMQR must contain non-zero MCC i.e., ‘XXXX’ assigned by the acquirer PSP.
(e) If this Payload Format Indicator (tag 00) has the value "99" (or any such value), then all tags as per existing EMVCo standards for customer presented card chip data to be followed.
(f) It is preferred that the PSP presents the data in sequence, however the counterparty PSP app must be able to read the data elements in any sequence.6

(g) All elements would have a Tag, followed by Length and the Value i.e., TLV format. The length field is 2 numeric from 00 to 99.
(h) For the optimization of bit stream length, it is recommended to encode in Numeric followed by Alphanumeric, using combined mode as recommended in Annex J of ISO / IEC 180042006-QR code 2005 barcode symbology specs.
(i) Any data elements and data element values defined as “reserved for future use” are reserved for future definition by this specification. These data elements and data elements values are only to be assigned by NAMQR operator (as identified by the industry). A payer / payee PSP app that encounters data that it recognizes as "reserved for future use" must not act on the data. A payer / payee PSP cannot add proprietary data elements into those tags.
(j) Merchant Id, Store Id, Terminal Id will be used by acquirer merchant for reconciliation /
## confirmation purposes. This will be echoed in all messages.
(k) Null values: This needs to be handled by PSP as Null value and should not passed into online message directly as a string value “null”
## (l) Space shall be handled as follows: while generating / creating / Reading a NAMQR, space (“
”) should be represented as “%20” and not “%”as to be compliant with existing Internet Standard RFC 3986 section 2.1 Percent-Encoding.
(m) NAMQR has a provision where the merchants can share bills / invoices with the customers before the transaction is authorized. The bills / invoices can either be downloaded as PDF or can be viewed on a browser. This provision requires the PSP applications to display an option called ‘view invoice’. This option will be present for NAMQR initiated pay transactions. When the user scans a QR, then they will get an option on the app to click that URL. This URL will redirect them to the invoice which can be either viewed or downloaded.
4.13 Data coding of NAMQR 1. For NAMQR code, all the data should be encoded using Byte Mode. (Alphanumeric Mode,
## Numeric mode, Kanji, Structured Append, and FCN1 mode shall not be used).
# 2. If the NAMQR code includes characters other than Alphanumeric Special, then it shall include an ECI mode indicator and ECI Designator, where the ECI Designator includes the binary representation of an ECI Assignment number equal to 000026, to indicate UTF-8 encoding.
## (Note that Alphanumeric Special includes Numeric).
4.14 QR Code Encoding QR codes have different density levels, determined by the version of the QR code, and different error correction modes, which help ensure the code can still be read even if it is partially damaged. Here's a
## brief overview:
Density (Versions) of QR Codes:
# 1. Version 1 to Version 40:
a. QR codes have 40 different versions, each specifying the number of modules (small squares) in the code.

## b. Version 1: 21 x 21 modules.
## c. Version 40: 177 x 177 modules.
d. As the version number increases, the QR code can store more data, but the size and complexity also increase.
## Error Correction Levels:
QR codes have four error correction levels, allowing the code to be read even if part of it is damaged.
The level you choose affects the amount of data that can be stored and the size of the code.
# 1. Level L (Low):
## a. Recovers 7% of data.
b. Most data storage capacity.
# 2. Level M (Medium):
## a. Recovers 15% of data.
b. A balance between data storage and error correction.
# 3. Level Q (Quartile):
## a. Recovers 25% of data.
b. More robust error correction, less data storage.
# 4. Level H (High):
## a. Recovers 30% of data.
## b. Highest error correction, least data storage.
## General Guidance Here are some factors to consider when selecting the level:
## Environment Where the QR Code Will Be Used:
# 1. Clean and Controlled Environments (e.g., indoor settings):
a. Use Level L or M: Since the risk of damage is low, you can prioritize data storage capacity.
# 2. Harsh or Dirty Environments (e.g., outdoor settings, industrial areas):
a. Use Level Q or H: These environments pose a higher risk of the QR code being damaged, so stronger error correction is advisable.
## Importance of Data Integrity:
# 1. Critical Data (e.g., financial information, secure access):
a. Use Level H: If data integrity is crucial and even small errors could lead to significant issues, opt for the highest error correction level.
# 2. Less Critical Data (e.g., general information, marketing):
a. Use Level L or M: For non-critical data, you can afford to use a lower level to store more data or keep the QR code size smaller.
## QR Code Size Constraints:
# 1. Limited Space for Displaying QR Code:

a. Use Level L: If you need the QR code to be as small as possible, Level L allows for the maximum amount of data storage with the smallest footprint.
# 2. Space is Not a Concern:
a. Use Level M, Q, or H: When space is not an issue, you can choose a higher level of error correction to ensure better reliability.
Amount of Data to Encode:
# 1. Large Amount of Data:
a. Use Level L or M: These levels allow more data to be stored within the same QR code version.
# 2. Small Amount of Data:
a. Use Level Q or H: If you are encoding a small amount of data, you can afford to use a higher level of error correction without significantly increasing the QR code size.
## Expected Wear and Tear:
# 1. High Risk of Physical Damage:
a. Use Level H: For codes that are likely to experience wear and tear, such as those on frequently handled products, use the highest level.
# 2. Low Risk of Physical Damage:
a. Use Level L or M: For codes that will remain in a controlled environment or will not be exposed to much handling, lower levels of correction are sufficient.
## Scanning Conditions:
# 1. Poor Scanning Conditions (e.g., low lighting, angled surfaces):
a. Use Level Q or H: Higher error correction helps ensure the code can be read even under lessthan-ideal conditions.
# 2. Good Scanning Conditions:
a. Use Level L or M: If the QR code will be scanned under optimal conditions, lower levels will suffice.
4.15 NAMQR Encoding Recommendation A balance between error correction level, data storage capacity, the likelihood of damage, and the importance of data integrity has to be found.
# 1. Limiting maximum payload to 512 characters as is done by EMVCo would be a good initial choice.
# 2. Several rendering formats may be allowed to accommodate different use cases.
# 3. The scanning application must ensure that the scanned payload is a valid NAMQR by validating the CRC, prompting a re-scan if needed.
## Error Correction Level:
# 1. Level M (Medium) or Level Q (Quartile) are most commonly used:

a. Level M (15% error correction): Often chosen because it offers a good balance between data capacity and error correction. This level ensures that the QR code can be reliably scanned even if it's slightly damaged or printed in a lower-quality format, which is common in merchant environments.
b. Level Q (25% error correction): Sometimes chosen for environments where the QR code might be more prone to damage (e.g., outdoor merchants, kiosks). This level offers stronger error correction, which can be critical if the QR code is exposed to more wear and tear.
## QR Code Version (Density):
# 1. Lower to Mid Versions (Version 1 to Version 10):
a. Version 1 (21 x 21 modules) to Version 10 (57 x 57 modules) are typical, depending on the amount of data being encoded.
b. Payee presented NAMQR codes would need to store a moderate amount of data, such as merchant account information, transaction amount, currency, and other payment-related information. These versions provide enough space to encode this data while keeping the QR code size manageable and easily scannable.
## Key Considerations:
# 1. Readability: Ensuring that the QR code can be easily scanned by a wide range of consumer devices, including smartphones with varying camera qualities.
# 2. Data Capacity: Balancing the need to include sufficient transaction details without making the QR code too dense or difficult to scan.
# 3. Environmental Factors: Considering where the QR code will be displayed (e.g., on a printed receipt,
on a POS screen, or as a sticker) and choosing an error correction level that compensates for potential damage or degradation.
## Common Practice:
# 1. Level M with Versions 3 to 5 is a typical configuration, as it provides a good compromise between size,
error correction, and data capacity. This setup ensures that the QR code remains small enough for practical use while still being resilient to minor damage or print quality issues.
# 5.

Achieving such interoperability, showcasing flows for NAMQR across such disparate payment streams is out of the scope of the current engagement of Digital Dimensions with BON /PAN.
## 15 P2M transactions to E-Money account will be possible only if merchants can have E-Money accounts as per the extant BoN regulations.
## 16 NAMQR can support this type of payment based on scope of IPP. BoN/ PAN to clarify if any of the existing payment streams support international transactions.
## 17 NAMQR will support Transactions originating from or ending at E Money accounts only if such transactions are permissible under the extant BoN regulations. If yes, NAMQR can provide necessary tags and parameters during operationalization phase.

A glance at the above table will make it apparent that the proposed NAMQR standards can be easily configured to facilitate a particular use case riding on any of the existing payment streams so long as such a use case is supported by that payment stream. The above table is to illustrate potential of NAMQR and by no means an exhaustive list of use cases. NAMQR will support new use cases as clarified above.
5.3 NAMQR tags and corresponding parameters for the use cases mentioned in the above sections 5.1 and 5.2 Showcased below are the tags and their corresponding parameters of NAMQR to further provide evidence of how the proposed standards can indeed support various use cases listed in this document.

6.1 Tampering and Spoofing Tampering and spoofing of QR codes involve attackers replacing or altering legitimate QR codes with their malicious versions. This can happen in both physical and digital environments:
# 1. Physical Tampering: Attackers can place stickers or posters with fraudulent QR codes over legitimate ones in public places like restaurants, retail stores, or advertisements. Users scanning these codes can be redirected to malicious websites or payment portals, leading to unauthorized transactions or data theft (European Payments Council) (Better Regulation).

# 2. Digital Spoofing: Online, attackers can embed malicious QR codes in emails, social media posts, or websites. These codes may appear to lead to legitimate sites or services but instead direct users to phishing sites or download malware onto their devices (Better Regulation).
6.2 Data Theft Data theft via QR codes occurs when sensitive information embedded in QR codes is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. This can happen in several ways:
# 1. Unencrypted Data: If QR codes contain unencrypted payment information, personal details, or authentication credentials, they can be easily intercepted and read by malicious actors. This information can then be used for fraudulent activities (European Payments Council) (Better Regulation).
# 2. Insecure Transmission: When users scan QR codes, the data transmitted over insecure networks can be intercepted. Attackers can capture this data during transmission, leading to potential data breaches (Better Regulation).
# 3. Embedded Malware: QR codes can be used to distribute malware that, once installed on a user’s device, can steal sensitive information. This malware can track keystrokes, capture screenshots, or access stored data on the device (European Payments Council).
6.3 Insecure QR Code Generation Insecure generation of QR codes refers to the creation of QR codes without proper security measures,
## making them vulnerable to manipulation and fraud:
# 1. Poor Security Practices: If QR codes are generated using tools or platforms that do not implement secure coding practices, they can be easily altered or replicated by attackers. Secure generation involves using cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the QR codes
## (European Payments Council).
# 2. Lack of Verification: Without proper verification mechanisms, users have no way to confirm the authenticity of the QR codes they are scanning. Secure QR code systems should include features that allow users to verify that the code is legitimate before proceeding with transactions (Better Regulation).
6.4 NAMQR Security Risks Mitigations 6.4.1 Threat of Data Confidentiality NAMQR data is considered non confidential because it does not directly reveal sensitive information like bank account details. Instead NAMQR proposes to use an alias (or any surrogate value such as mobile number or any such other unique number mapped to an SOV assigned by PSPs to their respective account holders to protect privacy of the payers and the payees).
Refer sections ‘Payee presented NAMQR code payment (using smart phone mobile banking application’, ‘Payee presented NAMQR code payment (using USSD channel)’ and ‘Payer presented NAMQR code payment – (Request to Pay)’ for illustration of transaction flow using Payee / Payer Identifier.

6.4.2 Threat of Data Integrity The threat of compromise of data integrity can be mitigated by the use of CRC and Token Vault.
## Refer tag ‘63’ in section ‘NAMQR code payload data objects’ for details of CRC.
For the below mentioned scenarios, mitigation measure recommended for NAMQR may be a Certified Token Vault23:
# 1. Domestic NAMQR for transactions using existing Namibian payment systems 2. Domestic NAMQR for interoperable transactions between existing Namibian payment systems and proposed IPP.
# 3. Domestic NAMQR for app based and USSD based transactions (using existing Namibian payment systems and proposed IPP).
# 4. International NAMQR (i.e., Purpose = 11).
# 5. Payer presented NAMQR (i.e., Point of initiation method = 13 and 14).
# 6. Customer presented NAMQR (card chip data)
At the time of NAMQR code generation, payee/payer PSP receives request for NAMQR code generation from the respective payee / payer along with the various parameters. Payee / payer PSP sends the NAMQR parameters to Token Vault. Token Vault stores the NAMQR parameters and maps them against a Token Vault Unique Identifier and sends this xx-digit unique identifier to payee / payer PSP. Payer / payer PSP generates NAMQR with the assigned Token Vault Unique Identifier (in tag 65)
## and other parameters and NAMQR code is displayed on the payee PSP app.
When this NAMQR code is scanned by the payer / payee PSP app, the respective payer / payee PSP sends NAMQR code validation request to Token Vault. Token Vault validates the NAMQR code parameters as scanned with the NAMQR parameters available in the Token Vault and sends the NAMQR code validation successful response to payer / payee PSP. In this manner, the Token Vault ensures that the NAMQR code is validated and if there is any discrepancy in any of the parameters
(e.g., merchant identifier, amount, etc), Token Vault shall provide failure response and hence prevent transaction using invalid NAMQR code.
Refer sections ‘Payee presented NAMQR code payment (using smart phone mobile banking application’, ‘Payee presented NAMQR code payment (using USSD channel)’ and ‘Payer presented NAMQR code payment – (Request to Pay)’ for illustration of transaction flow using Token vault.
8 7. Comparison between EMVCo, NQR and NAMQR specifications 23 For the purpose of this document, “Token Vault” means any generic Token Vault operated by a Payment System Operator (PSO) or a PSP as per the terms of authorisation issued by BON to such a PSO and / or PSP. BON may consider, at its discretion, one common Token Vault as a national infrastructure and “public good” to be operated by an entity specifically approved by BON for this purpose or allow any PSP(s) to use their proprietary Token Vaults or a combination of both, so long such Token Vault(s) adhere to the common standards, specifications, protocols and are accessible to all the PSPs for a fair price.

# 10. Summary of the existing and proposed retail payment streams in Namibia Following payment streams, and the relevant payment stream participants25 were considered for development of the NAMQR standards.
## Payment Purpose Participants stream NRTC In the Near Real-Time Credit Stream, a financial Financial institutions and institution initiates a payment from an account (A) PSPs authorized by BoN belonging to one of its account holders to bank account
(B) at a different financial institution. If all conditions are met, the funds are transferred from account A to account B within seconds.
EnDO In the Enhanced Debit Order Stream, a financial Financial institutions and institution requests payment to an account (A) PSPs authorized by BoN belonging to one of its account holders, from bank account (B) at a different financial institution. If all conditions are met, this results in the transfer of funds from account B to account A.

ATM The ATM Stream facilitates cash withdrawals at ATMs Financial institutions and using a debit or credit card as the payment instrument. PSPs authorized by BoN This process results in funds being transferred from the cardholder's account to the financial institution that owns the dispensed cash.
POSD The POS Debit Payment stream enables payments to Financial institutions and be made at merchant points of sale using a debit card PSPs authorized by BoN,
as the payment instrument. This results in the transfer merchants of funds from the cardholder's bank account to the merchant's account.
POSC The POS Credit Payment stream allows payments to Financial institutions and be made at merchant points of sale using a credit card PSPs authorized by BoN as the payment instrument. This results in the transfer of funds from the cardholder’s account to the merchant’s account.
IPP – The central payment and clearing system operated by Financial institutions and Proposed26 Instant Payment Namibia to facilitate the real-time PSPs authorized by BoN.
Banks and PIIs (Payment Instrument Issuers) will be 25 Role of the participants in various payment streams is as approved by BoN from time to time. NAMQR specifications per se do not enhance nor diminish the extant roles of any participants. NAMQR specifications have been formulated to facilitate carriage of the requisite payload by generating the QR code appropriate for the given payment stream.

## Annexure I - Signed QR 27 1. Signed QR 1.1 Signed QR Namibia is in the process of launching IPP which is a version of UPI operated by NPCI in India. IPP specifications provide for a signed QR and it has been assumed that when banks implement IPP, they will also have implemented the signed QR which is an integral feature of UPI and hence IPP. This document discusses signed QR in the context of NAMQR because it will be a readily available component of IPP and not a separate requirement of NAMQR implementation. Moreover, as clarified earlier in the section 6.4 ‘NAMQR Security Risks Mitigation’, NAMQR data is considered non confidential because it does not directly reveal sensitive information like bank account details, instead using an alias (or any surrogate value such as mobile number or any other such value assigned by the PSPs to identify their respective users) mapped to that SOV), thus protecting privacy of the payer and the payee. It is reiterated that the signed QR feature will be used only while making payments using IPP through mobile apps.
The threats of compromise of data integrity can also be mitigated through signed QR. QR code signing proves data integrity. Signed QR can be used for domestic 28 NAMQR for IPP app based transactions.
Signing of QR provides security while making payments by the customer, and help reduce issues related to non-verified entities, that can act as a source of QR and can imitate as an authorized source.
## Signed QR principles / rules:
1. “All QR based transactions if not originating from the trusted sources” (all unsigned QR) will appear as a warning to the end user. In case the QR is not signed, a warning message has to be displayed on the payer’s app. Only post confirmation from the payer, app should move forward.
# 2. If QR is signed, then the application should bypass passcode page. PSP needs to skip the app passcode in case of signed QR.
# 3. Acquirer PSP changes: An Acquirer PSP should be able to generate a digital signature-based QR for which a public key will be uploaded by Acquirer PSP into IPP central system through dedicated API.
# 4. Issuer PSP changes: An Issuer PSP should be able to download public key of that specific merchant using dedicated API. Whenever QR is accessed by the customer, the validation of public key should happen and if it is not a signed QR, Issuer PSP will throw an error “Unsolicited / Unauthenticated QR call”. Thus, the choice will be given to the customer to proceed or decline the transaction.
# 5. P2P PSP changes: A payee PSP should be able to generate a digital signature-based QR for which a public certificate will be uploaded by payee PSP into IPP central system through dedicated API.
# 6. PSP needs to follow the deep linking specifications.
1.2 Manage Verified Address Entries 27 Refer document ‘UPI Linking Specification cer 1 7 2_V12’ for Signed QR specifications shared in this section 28 Signed QR for international transactions is not available as per extant IPP specifications.

IPP offers a mechanism to protect users from attempts to spoof well known merchants such as Insurance, Travel, e-commerce players, telecom players, bill payment entities, etc. This mechanism is an API, where the PSPs can manage, and access the common collection of verified address entries.
## IPP, with the help of PSPs, has defined a process to manage these entries.
Merchant or acquirer PSP on behalf of merchant need to generate a key pair (public and private key with ECDSA 256 + SHA 256 specifications).
If acquirer PSP has generated the key pair, then private key can either be shared with merchant for QR generation or can be integrated in SDK directly. Merchant and acquirer PSPs shall also add provision for update of key pairs.
## Key Upload: Then merchant needs to share this public key with its acquirer PSP. Then acquirer PSP will upload its merchant public key on IPP with Manage VAE API. If acquirer PSP has generated the key for its merchant, then it can directly upload on IPP.
# 1.3 List Verified Address Entries - Signed QR Issuer PSP app reads the signed QR.
## If OrgId = ‘000000’ & MCC is non-zeros, then Issuer PSP should call ListVAE with reference to Merchant IPP full form alias for fetching merchant specific key (Verified merchant will fall under this rule).
## If OrgId and MCC are non-zeros, then Issuer PSP should call first ListVAE with Merchant IPP full form alias. If no entry is found in ListVAE, then the Issuer PSP can call ListKeys with parent OrgId to get the keys (mostly non verified merchants will fall under this rule).
## Key Download: Issuer PSP server needs to download all merchant keys and cache it on their server.
This cache needs to be updated daily by the Issuer PSP server. Each public key downloaded must be mapped with the Merchant IPP full form alias for which the key was uploaded.
## Searching the key: OrgId & Merchant IPP full form alias need to be extracted first. As the Orgid id
‘000000’, the public key needs to be looked in list VAE cache with Merchant IPP full form alias as search parameter. This key will be used for verifying the signature.
1.4 List Keys – Signed QR Payer PSP app reads the signed QR. If OrgId present in QR is non-zeros & MCC = 0000, then Payer PSP should call ListKeys for fetching Payee PSP keys.
This scenario broadly refers to QR generated by Payee PSP applications for P2P transactions. In such scenarios, public key could not be found in List VAE as the Payee is not a merchant.
## Key Download: Payer PSP server needs to download all PSP app keys and cache it on their server.
This cache needs to be updated daily by the payer PSP server. Each public key downloaded must be mapped with the payee PSP OrgId for which the key was uploaded.

## Searching Key: OrgId & Payee IPP full form alias need to be extracted first. As the orgid id ‘159991’,
the public key needs to be looked in List Keys cache with OrgID as the search parameter. This key will be used for verifying the signature.
1.5 Reading Signed QR 1. Following is the verification logic for reading the signed QR on IPP a. If OrgId present in QR is non-zeros & MCC = 0000, then Payer PSP should call ListKeys for fetching Payee PSP keys b. If OrgId = 000000 & MCC is non-zeros, then Issuer PSP should call ListVAE with reference to Merchant IPP full form alias for fetching merchant specific key (Verified merchant will fall under this rule)
c. If OrgId and MCC are non-zeros, then Issuer PSP should call first ListVae with Merchant IPP full form alias. If no entry is found in ListVAE, then the Issuer PSP can call ListKeys with parent OrgId to get the keys (mostly non verified merchants will fall under this rule).
d. Both OrgId and MCC = 0000 such a scenario doesn’t exist 1.6 Signature Signing of QR can be broadly segregated into merchant initiated & payee-initiated QR. The signing method for both are similar, however verification method for both of them varies.
Merchants can initiate QR from their mobile application, generate signed QR from their terminal, POS,
exit sensors. All the mentioned protocol for merchant-initiated method follow identical process for signing and verification.
1.7 Merchant initiated 1. IPP plays central role to provide certificate registry for all Acquirer PSPs and Merchants.
# 2. Acquirer PSP adds the public key for all their merchants using Manage VAE API which has block to capture public key of the merchant.
# 3. Issuer PSP uses the List VAE API to retrieve the public key of the merchant.
# 4. Merchant app uses the private key to sign the hashed content of the QR (SHA256 with RSA).
# 5. The Issuer PSP app uses the public key to verify the content integrity.
# 6. This helps to secure the data flows between PSPs apps using QR.

# 1. Key generation: Merchant app or the acquirer PSP switch on behalf of merchant needs to generate a key pair (public and private key with (ECDSA 256 + SHA 256) specifications.
If acquirer PSP switch has generated the key pair, then private key can either be shared with merchant app for QR generation or can be integrated in SDK directly. Merchant app and acquirer PSP shall also add provision for update of key pairs.
# 2. Key Upload: If merchant app has generated the key pair, then merchant app needs to share this public key with their acquirer PSP switch. Then acquirer PSP switch will upload their merchant public key on IPP with Manage VAE API. If acquirer PSP has generated the key for their merchant,
## then it can directly upload on IPP.
## Acquirer PSPs public key will be available at VAE or List key entry.
a. List VAE is having the merchant entry and having Signature key, then the key will be used for validating QR b. List VAE is having merchant entry and no signature key, use parent key for checking signature basis parent Org ID c. No entry in List VAE, use parent key for checking signature basis parent Org ID (non-verified merchant).
d. List Keys are used in case of fetching keys for P2P 3. Signing of QR:
a. Step 1: The merchant generates a QR string.

b. Step 2: The Specified QR string needs to be signed using ECDSA with SHA256 algorithm.
## c. Step 3: The output of the signature should be encoded with base 64.
## d. Step 4: The final encoded value should be appended to original QR string in the respective tag.
# 4. Key Download: Issuer PSP server needs to download all merchant keys and cache it on their server. This cache needs to be updated daily by the Issuer PSP server. Each public key downloaded must be mapped with the Merchant IPP full form alias for which the key was uploaded.
# 5. Searching the key: Orgid & Merchant IPP full form alias need to be extracted first. As the orgid id
‘000000’, the public key needs to be looked in list VAE cache with Merchant IPP full form alias as search parameter. This key will be used for verifying the signature.
# 6. Verifying the QR:
a. Step 1: The signature part needs to be extracted and separate the original text from the encrypted code.
b. Step: 2 Then the appended value must be decoded with base 64 c. Step 3: The entire QR string excluding the signed part will be passed into verify function along with signature and the public key of merchant for verification.
# 7. Actions:
a. If the verification is successful, then the application should bypass passcode page b. If verification is failure either due to corruption or tampering the signature, then the QR request must be declined stating ‘QR is tampered or corrupt’
c. If signature is not present in QR, then the application should show warning message to user that the ‘source of QR could not be verified’ and shall request for passcode to proceed with the payment.
1.8 Payee initiated This scenario broadly refers to QR generated by payee PSP app for P2P transactions. In such scenarios, public key could not be found in List VAE as the Payee is not a merchant.
# 1. Payee PSP app generates key pair and shares the public key using List Keys API with IPP .
# 2. Payer PSP retrieves all the other payee PSP keys using the List Keys API.
# 3. Payee PSP app uses the private key to sign the hashed content of the QR (SHA256 with RSA).
# 4. The Payer PSP app uses the public key to verify the content integrity.

# 1. Key generation & upload: The key pair will be generated by the Payee PSP app and shall be shared with IPP for the keys to get updated in List Keys API. Payee PSP app and Payee PSP switch shall have the provision for updating the key pair.
# 2. Signing of QR:
a. Step 1: The payee PSP app generates a QR string b. Step 2: The Specified QR string needs to be signed using SHA256 with ECDSA algorithm c. Step 3: The output of the signature should be encoded with base 64 d. Step 4: The final encoded value should be appended to original QR string in the respective tag.
# 3. Key Download:
## Payer PSP server needs to download all payee PSP app keys and cache it on their server. This cache needs to be updated daily by the payer PSP server. Each public key downloaded must be mapped with the payee PSP OrgID for which the key was uploaded.
# 4. Searching Key:
OrgID & Payee IPP full form alias needs to be extracted first. As the orgid id ‘159991’, the public key needs to be looked in List Keys cache with OrgID as the search parameter. This key will be used for verifying the signature.
# 5. Verifying the QR:

Step 1: The signature part needs to be extracted and separate the original text from the encrypted code Step 2: Then the appended value must be decoded with base 64 Step 3: The entire QR string excluding the signed part will be passed into verify function along with signature and the public key of payee for verification 6. Actions:
a. If the verification is successful, then the application should bypass passcode b. If verification is failure either due to corruption or tampering the signature, then the QR request must be declined stating ‘QR is tampered or corrupt’
c. If signature is not present in QR, then the application should show warning message to user that the ‘source of QR could not be verified’ and shall request for passcode to proceed with the payment.
